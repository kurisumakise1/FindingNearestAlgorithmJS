# SortingAlgorithmJS
This algorithm takes sets(sets that have same length) sorts them then creates table with them.Once you press "Make It Continue" it randomly generates number and selects,calculates one square according to that number,if its bigger than the target or smaller it eliminates according to the situation.If its target it writes it.Once you press solve button it calculates blue ones and writes nearest one.
Feel free to use and give my name at credits(if you really dont wanna then ok).
